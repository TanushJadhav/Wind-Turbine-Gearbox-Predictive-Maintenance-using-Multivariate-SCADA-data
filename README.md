## ðŸš€ About the Project

This project focuses on predictive maintenance for wind turbine gearboxes using multivariate SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) data. Gearbox failures in wind turbines are costly and can lead to significant downtime. By analyzing real-time sensor dataâ€”such as gearbox temperatures, wind speed, power output, and bearing temperaturesâ€”the project aims to detect early signs of failure and issue timely alerts.

The core idea is to develop a machine learning pipeline that can:
- Clean and preprocess SCADA time-series data
- Engineer meaningful features from multiple sensor signals
- Train models (like Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) to classify or detect anomalies
- Evaluate performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
- Deploy the model to predict future faults and support maintenance decisions

This system can help wind farm operators schedule maintenance more effectively, reduce unplanned outages, and extend equipment life.
